# BS Company Games - Todo List

## Project Overview
Personal offline game hosting website for Flash (.swf) games using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Ruffle Flash emulation.

## Current Project State
- ‚úÖ Basic HTML structure with index.html and game.html
- ‚úÖ Game database (games.js) with 10 games configured
- ‚úÖ **WORKING** Ruffle Flash emulator integration using direct API
- ‚úÖ Basic CSS styling with yellow/black theme
- ‚úÖ Game images and SWF files organized in folders
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Games now load instantly through Ruffle (no more downloads!)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Game containers auto-fit to actual game dimensions
- ‚úÖ Fullscreen mode with exit button and ESC key support
- ‚úÖ All missing game files copied from Downloads folder
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE**: Fullscreen stretching still not working properly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Several HTML files deleted from git (shows in git status)

## Important Notes for Claude
- **Project Type**: Personal offline game website hosted on GitHub
- **Flash Games**: Uses .swf files with Ruffle emulator for modern browser compatibility
- **CRITICAL - How Flash Games Work**: 
  - **Ruffle** is the main Flash emulator that powers all games on this site
  - Ruffle is a Rust-based Flash Player replacement that runs in modern browsers
  - Games must be loaded through `<ruffle-embed>` elements, NOT direct iframe links
  - Direct .swf file links cause browsers to download files instead of running them
  - Ruffle converts Flash content to WebAssembly for browser compatibility
- **File Structure**: 
  - `/games/` - Contains .swf game files
  - `/images/` - Contains game thumbnails
  - `/ruffle/` - Contains Ruffle Flash emulator files (local installation)
  - External Ruffle loaded from: `https://unpkg.com/@ruffle-rs/ruffle`
- **Current Issues**: 
  - **URGENT**: Games still downloading .swf files instead of playing through Ruffle
  - Navigation links (Search/Games) are non-functional
  - HTML structure has some invalid nesting (h1 inside logo div)
  - TU-95 game missing thumbnail image (images/tu95.png)
